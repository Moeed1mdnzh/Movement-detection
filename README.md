# movement detection
'''
HOW IT WORKS : This program actually compares the last frame with the current frame by subtracting them.
This project has 2 modes. mode 0 is the normal mode and mode 1 has more accuracy(its better to use it in an area with lower brightness).
Required modules : opencv-python(cv2) and numpy
