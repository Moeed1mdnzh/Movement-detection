# movement detection
This program is supposed to detect moving objects. it works pretty nice but not as always.I used opencv for this project.
# HOW IT WORKS
This program actually compares the last frame with the current frame by subtracting them.
# MODES
This project has 2 modes. mode 0 is the normal mode and mode 1 has more accuracy(its better to use it in an area with lower brightness).
# Required modules 
opencv-python(cv2) and numpy
